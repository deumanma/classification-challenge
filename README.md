# Spam Detector: Random Forest vs. Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project evaluates the performance of two machine learning models, Random Forest and Logistic Regression, on a given dataset. Through rigorous testing, it was found that the Random Forest model outperforms Logistic Regression with an accuracy score of .95, compared to the latter's .92. This README outlines the steps to install, configure, and run the models for comparison.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy

Make sure all dependencies are installed using pip:

pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy


## Results
The Random Forest model achieved an impressive accuracy score of 95%, demonstrating superior performance over the Logistic Regression model, which scored 92%. These results suggest that Random Forest may be more suitable for this particular dataset, likely due to its ability to handle complex, nonlinear relationships more effectively.
